## Prject Outline
Inspiration
Our inspiration came from having equal education for everyone. In the age of technology, we believe that anyone is able to receive education regardless of where they are in the world. It's only one device away.

What it does
We created a website called EduAll which is a personalized website based on a survey that the user fills out before using the website. After completing the survey, the website is personalized according to the user.

How we built it
We built the website using html, css, javascript and Java. We used Springboot for the backend.

Challenges we ran into
We struggled to work on the backend and have the website work as we wanted to. Therefore, we had to watch a bunch of videos to somewhat grasp the backend section of the project.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Honestly, our accomplishment is that we attended the hackathon since it's everyones first hackathon in the group.

What we learned
We learned how we can use Java to incorporate the backend. We also learned mapping of websites which we did not know of before.

What's next for EduAll
In the future, we plan to make EduAll the way we originally wanted it to by using the material we will learn in the future.
