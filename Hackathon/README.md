# Our idea:

We are going to try creating a website which will cover the following topics:

How can we use technology to provide quality education for populations in need?
How do we promote healthy and sustainable living for general populations?

 - Implementing a website where the population can access a general daily education 
 - Going to attempt to make the website into an app in the later stages as well
 - Also include the pages where we can implement a more specified curriculum and users can sign up based on their education level
 - Include a page where we focus on education towards healthy and sustainable living
